1. STMBench7 - Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------

STMBench7 is a benchmark for evaluating software transactional memory
(STM) implementations. For documentation, please refer to the project
web page: 

    http://lpd.epfl.ch/site/research/tmeval
    
Important note. The benchmark is still a work in progress. The code
and the specification may still undergo many, maybe significant,
changes that should reflect the feedback we will get.
    
Any suggestions, comments or criticism are more than welcome and
should be send to Michal Kapalka (e-mail: firstname.lastname@epfl.ch).
    
    
2. Running the Benchmark
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Java version of the benchmark requires JRE 1.5 or newer. The
JAR file provided with the default benchmark distribution contains
all the necessary binary files to run the benchmark.

For example,

	java -jar stmbench7-07.03.2008-beta.jar
	
will run the current version of the benchmark with the default
parameters (shown at the beginning of a benchmark run). To see the
command-line syntax, run the benchmark with the "-h" or "--help"
argument.

Note that the benchmark requires a lot of memory, so it may be
necessary to increase the JVM heap size (with the "-Xmx" parameter
of the "java" program).

3. Compiling the Benchmark
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The build system of the benchmark now uses Apache Ant. The Ant targets
provided are: "compile" (to compile the benchmark), "jar" (to generate
a JAR file), and "dist" (to make a tgz archive for distribution). For
example,

	ant jar
	
will compile the benchmark and generate the JAR file. JDK 1.5 or
newer is required to build the benchmark from sources.

It is simple, however, to compile the benchmark using only "javac", 
by compiling together all the Java files in the "src" directory,
except ones in the "test" subdirectory (those require JUnit and
can be compiled separately).
